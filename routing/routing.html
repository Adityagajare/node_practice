                North Karnataka is a geographical region in Deccan plateau from 300 to 730 metres (980 to 2,400 ft) elevation that constitutes the region of the Karnataka state in India and the region consists of 13 districts. It is drained by the Krishna River and its tributaries the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra. North Karnataka lies within the Deccan thorn scrub forests ecoregion, which extends north into eastern Maharashtra. <br>
                North Karnataka consists of total 13 districts and comprises the regions known as (Hyderabad-Karnataka) - Kalaburagi division and (Bombay-Karnataka) - Belagavi division. It includes districts of Bagalkote, Bijapur, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri, Belagavi, Bellary, Bidar, Kalaburagi, Koppal, Raichur, Vijayanagara and Yadgir. <br>
                North Karnataka's history[3][4] and culture date back to prehistoric times. The earliest Stone Age find in India was a hand ax at Lingasugur, in Raichur district. Sangankal Hills in the Bellary district, which is known as the earliest village settlement of South India,[5] dates back to the Neolithic period. Iron weapons from 1200 BC, found at Hallur in Dharwad district, demonstrate that North Karnataka used iron earlier than northern India.[6] Prehistoric sites in North Karnataka include rock shelters in Bellary, Raichur and Koppal districts with red paintings[7] which include figures of wild animals. The paintings are done in such a way that the walls of caves are not facing northwest, so the northwest monsoon does not affect them. These rock shelters are found at Kurgod, Hampi in Bellary district and Hire Benakal, near Gangavati in the Koppal district. Burial chambers using granite slabs (known as dolmens) are also found; the best examples are the dolmens of Hire Benakal and Kumati in Hadagali Taluk.
